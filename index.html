<p style= "font-size:20px; text-align:center;line-height:30px margin-bottom:50px">Welcome to BHIKARI SMP – Where Legends Start From Nothing!
BHIKARI SMP is not your ordinary Minecraft server. It’s a wild survival multiplayer experience where everyone starts from zero – no kits, no cheats, no rich loot handed out. Just raw survival, chaos, teamwork, betrayal, and the grind to become the richest from being a true “bhikari” (beggar)! Whether you're a solo adventurer or planning to build an empire with friends, BHIKARI SMP gives you the platform to create your legacy.

<br>A Survival World Full of Possibilities
We offer a completely vanilla survival experience with slight QoL improvements to enhance fun without ruining the grind. PvP is allowed, alliances can be formed or broken, and wars can spark at any moment. Events, challenges, economy systems, and hidden secrets across the map keep things fresh and exciting. Whether you want to become the richest trader, strongest warrior, or sneakiest rogue — it’s your story to write.

<br>Join the Chaos – Your Journey Awaits
Our server is hosted on Aternos and available 24/7 (when turned on). To join, just connect using the IP that you will found in our discord server.We welcome both Java and Bedrock players (if crossplay is enabled), and the server is kept updated with the latest version. Make sure you’re ready — this world doesn’t forgive easily, and only the most clever and consistent players rise above.
